                    typographic standards used
                    in books,
                    have made him an important figure in the field of Typography.</p>

            <div class="aboutPghs">
                <p class="aboutP1"> Jan Tsichold was first introduced
                    to this style at the Bauhaus in Germany, the country he was born in. While still in Germany he
                    published <i class="openItalics">The New Typography</i> explaining the modernist approach. In 1933
                    though, Tschichold
                    and
                    his mentor Paul Renner, were accused of being “cultural bolshevik[s]” (Britannica Academic). The
                    modernist style at this time greatly resembled the Russian avant garde. Subsequently, Tschichold
                    and Renner fled to Switzerland.
                    <br><br>Later on in his career, Tschichold moved to Britain to work for Sir Allen Lane at Penguin
                    books.
                    Penguin books, who at the time, had established a reputation for cheap, quality books for ‘all
                    classes of people’ (Grace Lees-Maffei 59). This philosophy was mirrored in modernist design which
                    advocated for more-readable type, and a focus on functionality so that text the message was clearly
                    conveyed. At Penguin Books, Tschichold went on to create ‘The Penguin Composition Rules’ as he
                    noticed a complete lack of consistency and uniformity in their work;
                </p>

                <p class="aboutP2">
                    At Penguin, he oversaw the design of 500 books and developed specialised series (such as The Pelican
                    Shakespeare)
                    (Grace Lees-Maffei 61). Tschichold's work at Penguin would have a lasting influence on the British
                    publishing industry.
                    <br><br>Interestingly enough, later on in his career Tschichold came to associate modernism with
                    fascist and the Nazi belifs
                    and principles, calling it ‘millitaristic’ (Tschichold 16). He returned to traditional type styles,
                    building
                    off of historical typography such as Roman and Egyptian scripts (Meggs 355). It was at this time he
                    developed Sabon,
                    a well known and widely used serif typeface.

            <blockquote class="aboutQuote"> <q>The printers who set the type either had no composition rules at all, or
                    worked to nineteenth-century conventions, or followed one set or another of house rules...</q>
