                        Typography</i>he New Typography, modernist typography, has shaped the current state of
                    typographic
                    and design standards.</span> Modernism, as mentioned before <a class="inlineLink"
                    href="tNT.html">(see The New
                    Typography)</a>, aimed to distill
                typography down to its communicative purpose through the use of sans-serif typefaces,
                through whitespace as a structural component, etc. Designers such as Tschichold,
                reflected on industrialist society and the growing use of machines to simplify
                tasks and increase efficiency.
                <br><br>Today, we use computers in our everyday lives,
                and more often than not, sans serif fonts are used as they are easily readable.
                Not only have these principles shaped our current typographic standards but they
                have greatly contributed to the field of design. In <i class="openItalics">The New Typography</i>,
                Tschichold
                continued to develop Gestalt principles that he saw used at the Bauhaus, such as
                space as a structural element which is also known as figure-ground. Tschichold’s
                book was very important, as mentioned before, because it spread these modernist
                ideas and laid out rules that others could clearly understand and translate to
                their own work- which they did. Like Gutenberg with his vernacular bible, Tschichold’s
                book was the mode of communication, the conveyer of these ideas rather than the originator.
                This is not to say that Tschichold did not innovate and make great contributions of his own
                through his own design work.
                <br><br>At the end of <i class="openItalics">The New Typography</i>, Tschichold also includes a
                bibliography where he points readers to others who exemplify and work within this area of
                design, such as EL Lisitzky (Beatens 78).
