            <p class="tntP1">Tschichold’s most significant contribution to the field of typography was his book
                <i class="openItalics">The New Typography: A Handbook for Modern Designers (Die neue Typographie: Ein
                    Handbuch für Zeitgemäss Schaffende)</i>, that bolstered modernist typographic practices.
                Tschichold first discovered modernist design on a visit to the Bauhaus in Weimar in
                1923 (Britannica Academic). The Bauhaus is known for developing and exploring design
                principles, Gestalt Principles. Tschichold's brand of modernism was influenced by
                rationalism, constructivism, and the avant garde. Modernism was not only restricted
                to design, many people saw it as a philosophy, or a ‘spirituality’- as a representation
                of the dynamism of the modern world (Meggs 355). Tschichold's book was one of the first
                to explain this style of design as it applied to typography to a wider audience
                (Meggs 353). In this book he talks about balancing space, asymmetric typographic
                principles, grid structures, communicative function, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="tntP2">In addition, he advocated strongly for sans-serif typefaces as they were more
                readable/legible and therefore more pragmatic for advertising, for communicating a
                message, and for the public at large.Modernist ideas had a focus on the future and
                growing industrialization; Tschichold “emphasized the nature of machine composition
                and its impact on the design process and product” (Meggs 355). The straight forward
                nature of machines and their focus on one task for which they were built was applied
                to typography in that it’s primary purpose was to communicate.
                <br> <br>One of the asymmetric typographic principles that we are quite familiar with is flush
                left ragged right paragraphs/sentences. Many of the principles Tschichold discussed and
                developed during the 20th century, such as flush left ragged right, are now the standard
                in the 21st century.
