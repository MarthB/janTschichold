            <h1>SABON</h1>
            <p class="sabonHist">Sabon is a typeface that Tschichold created after he became disillusioned
                with Modernist ideals. He felt that they came to embody the ideals upheld by fascism and
                the Nazi regime in Germany. They were ‘utilitarian’ and only lived to serve a purpose-
                there was no feeling. Thereafter, Tschichold returned to old style or classical styles
                (The Thames & Hudson Dictionary). Sabon is a more humanist typeface (Figure 1) and reflects
                his change in ideology. It was also the first typeface designed for linotype, monotype, and
                hand composition so to maintain consistency between the three different printing methods
                (The Thames & Hudson Dictionary).
                <br><br>The typeface is named after Jakob Sabon who worked under the French punchcutter Claude Garamond
                (Monotype). The typeface was built from specimen sheets created by Garamond and Robert Granjon
                which were released from Sabon’s own foundry long after his death by his widower and her second
                husband (Monotype).

        </div>
        <div class="rightColumn">
            <div class="sabonClassFormat">
                <div class="redDivider"></div>
                <p class="sabonClassification">Sabon, the typeface, is an old style serif typeface as its
                    strokes are very calligraphic in nature. There is contrast but it is low compared to
                    a ‘modernist’ typeface. Sabon also possesses an angled emphasis as well as some bracket
                    serifs. Seeing as it was based off of Garamond, another old style typeface, it mimics
                    Garamond’s ‘P’ in that the bowl does not fully connect with the stem.
