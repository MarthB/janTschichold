                <div class="etPghs">
                    <p class="etp1">The title page of Elementare Typographie (See Link 1), is an embodiment of all
                        of Tschichold’s New Typography. You will notice that the colours he chose: red,
                        white, and black, are those commonly used in the Russian/Soviet Avant Garde
                        and constructivist works (which also emerged from the Soviet Union). The layout
                        is asymmetrical but yet the composition is balanced. The composition also has
                        closure (or is self-contained); the text is arranged in a rectangular structure
                        which directs the viewer’s eye back into the composition. Tschichold uses both
                        colour, direction, type size, and font weight to create hierarchy. The first
                        thing that attracts a viewer’s eye is the largest piece of text, the name of
                        the magazine, bracketed by the only red bars on the page. Next, it goes to the
                        heavy set text ‘elementare typographie’ in the center of the page, then to the
                        thinner type of the same size, above it. After that comes the list of artists
                        whose work is featured in this booklet. The text is significantly smaller but
                        can be read easily as it is horizontal and may actually be in a wider set font.
                        In addition, it is bracketed by a black rectangle. The last, least important piece of
                        text, is of the smallest size and is rotated vertically making it hard to read.
                    </p>
                    <p class="etp2">It is also important to note that in this composition, Tschichold uses the flush
                        left, ragged right paragraph structure on the list of artists as well as, a
                        sans-serif typeface, and grid structure. The white space is not used so
                        evidently as a structural element in this composition as it is in others
                        (such as the Die Hose movie poster (See Link 2)) but it is balanced and
                        clearly takes it into account based on his use of the red and black bars.
                        The bars allow the composition to look organised, systematic ,and methodical;
                        without them the composition would look significantly less disciplined and impactful.
